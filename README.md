# Akeeba Build Tools — Public Packager

Phing helper to build installable Joomla!® extension and WordPress plugin ZIP package files.

This minimal Phing script is made for use with Akeeba software for Joomla and WordPress. It will assemble all the files in our public repositories into installable ZIP packages. You can install these ZIP packages on your own site.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Akeeba Build Tools — Public Packager does not install Composer dependencies, NPM dependencies, or do JS and CSS compilation / minification. It only operates on the files which already exist on disk.
>
> Akeeba Build Tools — Public Packager does not allow you to do release automation. All release targets and their associated tooling are neutered in this version so that this repository does NOT classify as a “product with digital elements” under the EU CRA.

Akeeba Build Tools — Public Packager is NOT a standalone builder in the sense of building a whole project from a bare checkout; it needs an extension-specific Phing build file and an already-resolved source tree to work from. It is deliberately kept separate from our internal [akeeba/buildfiles](https://github.com/akeeba/buildfiles), Akeeba Ltd's internal build tooling, which does considerably more (and does talk to the network).

## Requirements

You need a Linux or macOS environment. WSL2 on Windows is fine; it's Linux running inside a VM.

> [!WARNING]
> We do not test with or support Windows proper (CMD.EXE, or PowerShell), MSYS2 / MinGW, etc. We do not test or support BSD distributions. Only Linux and macOS are tested and supported. 

The build script depends on your environment having specific software installed. You need the following in your `$PATH`:

- [Phing](https://www.phing.info) itself. You can install it through Composer (recommended), or use its PHAR archive.
- [PHP](https://php.net) CLI.
- `xsltproc`, part of [libxslt](https://github.com/GNOME/libxslt/tree/master). Optional. Used for building documentation.

## Before using

Copy the `phing/default.properties` file as `build.properties` and place that file in the directory _above_ this repository's working copy. Your filesystem layout should look like this:

- `build.properties` The file copied from `phing/default.properties`. 
- `buildfiles` The working copy of Akeeba Build Tools — Public Packager.
- `whatever` (The name of the directory varies) The working copy of the software you will be building packages for (e.g. Kickstart).

Edit the `build.properties` file. It's in INI format. At the very least you need to set up the following:

- `system.php_cli` The path to your [PHP](https://php.net) CLI binary. 
- `docs.xsltproc` Optional. Only used for building the documentation. The path to your `xsltproc` binary, part of [libxslt](https://github.com/GNOME/libxslt/tree/master).

> [!TIP]
> You can find the paths to these binaries by running `which php` and `which xsltproc` respectively.

## Usage

You do not use this repository directly. The `build.xml` files in our software's repositories include `../buildfiles/phing/common.xml` – the file from Akeeba Build Tools — Public Packager. The following instructions apply to the working copies _of the software you are going to be building_, not the working copy of Akeeba Build Tools — Public Packager.

Go to the working copy of the software you want to build.

Resolve its dependencies first by running `composer install`. Some repositories may also need `npm install`; if so, it's documented in their `README.md` file. Remember, Akeeba Build Tools — Public Packager **DOES NOT** do that step for you; the reason is explained below.

Run `phing git` to produce the installable ZIP in the working copy's `release` directory; the directory is created automatically. This command creates a _dev release_, versioned as such.

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT CREATE STABLE-VERSIONED PACKAGES, WITH OR WITHOUT A VERSION SUFFIX, FROM ANY BRANCH OF OUR SOFTWARE'S REPOSITORY.** The branches contain _in-development_ code. If you want to build a stable version of our software, please make sure to check out the Git **tag** of that version instead.

To create a package of a stable release run `phing -Dversion=1.2.3` where `1.2.3` is the version number. You can find the version number at the top of the `CHANGELOG` or `CHANGELOG.md` file in the software's working copy.

To avoid any ambiguity on whether a package is "official" or not, you MUST an identifying version suffix to your builds. If you are building version `1.2.3` of an extension, please use something like `phing -Dversion=1.2.3-something` where `something` is something that identifies you, e.g. your name, initials, username etc.

## Why is there no Composer, NPM, JS/CSS building, or release automation?

Installing Composer dependencies requires network access. Installing the tooling necessary for JS/CSS compilation and minification requires network access. Release automation requires network access, obviously.

Having anything which directly or indirectly requires network access in this repository, and quite possibly us telling you how to do the same yourself, would classify this repository as a “product with digital elements” under the EU CRA. This would require time-consuming red tape which would make it financially non-viable for us to publish Free and Open Source Software without charging a fee.

We had two options. We could either stop publishing our free-of-charge software or create a cut-down version of our build and release automation tooling which removes everything that needs network access. We chose the latter.

You can still build installable packages of our software – that's the whole point! We _do_ ship both the compiled / minified CSS and JS files, and their corresponding sources. This lets you build the same package we build and distribute ourselves. However, if you do make any modifications to the sources, you have to provide your own tooling and process to produce the compiled / minified CSS and JS files. Regrettably, we cannot help you with that.

If you think that is absurd, and you're an EU citizen, we urge you to write to your European Parliament representatives to tell them how and why the EU CRA negatively affects you.

## Regulatory status (EU Cyber Resilience Act)

This repository contains a minimal Phing build script that assembles an installable extension ZIP package from an already-prepared source tree and a `vendor/` directory populated by the user beforehand and under their own control. It makes no network connections of its own, has no dependency-resolution or fetch logic, and its intended and foreseeable use is limited to local file packaging. It is not a "product with digital elements" as defined in Art. 3(1) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 (the Cyber Resilience Act), which requires intended or foreseeable use involving a direct or indirect connection to a device or network. It is published to satisfy GPLv3's "Corresponding Source" requirement and to support reproducible builds by third parties. This statement reflects our assessment as of 27 August 2026 and will be revisited if that scope changes.
